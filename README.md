# I'm not here anymore. 
I am no longer using github as my primary git forge.

If you're hiring me then I'm willing and able to work wherever your code lives. 
For everything else [here are my own projects](https://mygit.link/gwen/) and [here are the projects I create in colaboration with my worker cooperative](https://code.emma.coop/gwen/).

A better world is possible, we're making it every day.
