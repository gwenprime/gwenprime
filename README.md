# I'm not here anymore. 
I am not willing to participate with a corporation which works with ICE, sells user data to train AIs, and squeezes labor from the open source community to the benefit of big tech.

If you're hiring me then I'm willing and able to work wherever your code lives. For everything else [here are my own projects](https://mygit.link/gwen/) and [here are the project I create in colaboration with my worker cooperative](https://code.emma.coop/gwen/).

A better world is possible, we're making it every day.
